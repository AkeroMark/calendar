The Baremetrics date range picker is a simplified solution for selecting both date ranges and single dates all from a single calender view. There aren't a billion options but the code is pretty basic and modular so feel free to edit however to meet your own needs.

I've included my signature gulpfile too so be sure and take a look at that as well.

```bash
$ cd <project directory>
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

I also use [pow](http://pow.cx/) and the [powder gem](https://github.com/Rodreegez/powder) to run my local dev environments but however you plan on wrangling that the gulpfile turns on a livereload server so as long as you have the files serving somehow any changes you make will show up instantly.
